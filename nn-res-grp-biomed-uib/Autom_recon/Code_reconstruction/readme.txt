This package contains Matlab code for semi-automated reconstruction of neurons as described in:

Zandt BJ, LosnegaÌŠrd A, Hodneland E, Veruki ML, Lundervold A, Hartveit E (2017)
Semi-automatic 3D morphological reconstruction of neurons with densely branching morphology:
Application to retinal AII amacrine cells imaged with multi-photon excitation microscopy;
Journal of Neuroscience Methods 279, 101- 118

Please see the provided tutorial for instructions on using the code.

For questions feel free to contact Bas-Jan Zandt ( Bas-Jan.Zandt@epfl.ch; www.researchgate.net/profile/Bas-Jan_Zandt)
or Espen Hartveit ( espen.hartveit@biomed.uib.no )

Some of the subroutines were adopted from:
- CellSegm cell segmentation toolbox ( https://github.com/ehodneland/cellsegm )
- Accurate Fast Marching toolbox
( www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/24531-accurate-fast-marching )

Furthermore, two toolboxes were included in this package in full (in xtra folder):
- cbiNifti ( http://www.pc.rhul.ac.uk/staff/J.Larsson/software.html )
- TREES toolbox v1.15 ( www.treestoolbox.org )

Please see the readme's and licenses in the respective files/directories.
